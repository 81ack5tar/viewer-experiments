2015-05-03 ~ San Francisco. Hi, my name is Theo Armour. I was introduced to WikiHouse by my daughter [Alix]( http://nimblescooters.com/about-us/ ) and became instantly intrigued.
What I like to do is grab data files that are locked up in hard disks and do my best to help them sing and dance on the web in 3D.

Remember, it will take a while for the files to 'warm up'. Here are the first work-in-progress steps. Each of the three current projects has its own overview page as well as demos that run in your browser
